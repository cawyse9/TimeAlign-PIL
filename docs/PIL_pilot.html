<h3>Research Team:</h3>
<p>Prof Lorna M. Lopez, Maynooth University<br />
Dr Cathy Wyse, Maynooth University<br />
Mr Jake Kennedy, Maynooth University</p>
<p>Study Contact/Advis</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this
information carefully and discuss it with your family if you wish. Take
your time to read it and don’t feel under any pressure to decide right
away. It is important for you to understand the study fully before you
decide to participate or not. If anything is unclear to you, or if you
have any questions at all about the study, please don’t hesitate to get
in touch with us by email (<a href="mailto:TimeAlign@mu.ie"
class="email">TimeAlign@mu.ie</a>).</p>
<p>You are invited to participate in this research study which aims to
investigate the timing of medication as well as sleep and circadian
rhythms in people with epilepsy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="why-are-we-doing-this-research-study" class="section level3">
<h3>Why are we doing this research study?</h3>
<p>Circadian rhythms are changes in physiology and behaviour that follow
a 24-hour cycle. For example, the daily rhythm in body temperature,
alertness and the sleep wake cycle are all examples of circadian
rhythms. In fact, almost every cell in the human body is regulated by a
circadian clock, and this does not depend on the light dark cycle or the
timing of food or exercise. Circadian timing has been “hard-wired” into
our physiology by evolution so that humans have 24h rhythms by
default.</p>
<p>It has been known for centuries that the occurrence of seizures in
some people with epilepsy follow daily or monthly patterns. For example,
some people only have seizures at night, or at a particular time of day.
It is possible that circadian clocks in the brain contribute to these
patterns.</p>
<p>Medication is an important aspect of seizure control, and in
TimeAlign, we will investigate if variations in the times of day that
people with epilepsy take their medication is related to the timing of
their seizures.</p>
<p>The overall aim of this project is to assess daily patterns in sleep
and circadian timing and the timing of medication in people with
epilepsy, and to investigate if any of these patterns match the timing
of seizures.</p>
<p>Many people with epilepsy have infrequent seizures, so that long
periods of monitoring (several months) are required to capture patterns
in their timing. In this project, we will use advances in sensor
technology to unobtrusively monitor the timing of sleep, medication and
activity in order to minimise the burden on the participants that are
happy to participate in our research over long periods of time.</p>

<div id="why-am-i-being-asked-to-take-part-in-this-research-study"
class="section level3">
<h3>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h3>
<p>We have asked you to take part because you are a person with epilepsy
that is taking daily anti-epileptic drugs.<br />
To participate you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have been diagnosed with epilepsy by a neurologist<br />
</li>
<li>Be currently taking anti-seizure medication at least once per
day<br />
</li>

</li>
<li>Have access to email and the internet<br />
</li>
<li>You and anyone sharing your bedroom must be happy to have radar
sensors fitted at the bedside</li>
</ul>
<p>You can not participate if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are pregnant<br />
</li>
<li>Have any infectious disease<br />
</li>
<li>Have allergies or skin condition that might affect your ability to
have sensors attached to your skin, or to wear a wrist watch</li>
</ul>

<div id="do-i-have-to-take-part" class="section level3">
<h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
<p>It is important to know that you do not have to take part in this
study if you do not wish to. You can change your mind about
participating in this study at any time, even after the study has begun.
If you decide that you do not want to participate, this will have no
effect on your current or future participation in any other research
studies. You do not have to provide a reason for deciding not to
participate or changing your mind. If you wish to opt out at any point,
please contact the research team (Study email: <a
href="mailto:TimeAlign@mu.ie" class="email">TimeAlign@mu.ie</a>), and we
will organise this for you.</p>

</div>
<div
id="what-happens-if-i-change-my-mind-about-participating-during-the-study"
class="section level3">
<h3>What happens if I change my mind about participating during the
study?</h3>
<p>You can withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. If you
decide to do so, we will immediately remove all of your data from the
study, including your sensor, sleep and questionnaire data. Electronic
copies of data will be overwritten, and hard copies will be destroyed by
incineration.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-the-study-be-carried-out" class="section level3">
<h3>How will the study be carried out?</h3>
<p>The studies will be carried out as you undergo your usual activities
over 12 months, you will not be required to come to Maynooth University
at any point. We will give you everything you need to set up the sensors
yourself. We will always give you instructions and all materials and
equipment needed to complete the study and we will always be available
to answer any questions you have about the study.<br />
 </p>
<p>You will be asked to do the following tasks:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Wear a wrist-worn activity monitor</strong> (like a Fitbit)
at all times (day and night) for 1 week. You will need to remove the
monitor for showering or swimming, and put it back on as soon as
possible afterwards. The device will monitor movement and light exposure
continuously throughout the day and night.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Fit a bedside sensor</strong> that monitors movement and
environment in your bedroom for 1 week (see image below). The sensor
records the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement</li>
<li>Room temperature</li>
<li>Sound in decibels</li>
<li>Light</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>This sensor uses radar to monitor movement and we can use this
information to design algorithms that can guess whether you are awake or
asleep. We cannot tell what you are doing when you are awake. It records
noise levels, not sounds or voices and ambient light. This sensor
transmits data via the internet to a cloud platform where we can
download your data.</p>
<p>The sensor has its own internet connection and you will not be able
to download the data or access the sensor controls. It is unobtrusive
and makes no sound, and has no display. If you go on holiday or stay
somewhere else overnight, we will ask you to bring the bedside sensor if
possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Complete some questionnaires</strong> about your health,
lifestyle and sleep. Questionnaires will take approximately 10 minutes
each to complete and there are 3 in total.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep a small sensor with your current pill box</strong>,
or where you keep your medication. You need to press the button each
time you take your medication which will record the times. This device
has no communication function, it can only record and store time
data.</p>
<p>We will ask you to return the device to us in prepaid envelopes so
that we can download the data. We will send you a new device at these
times. We will keep in touch with you and remind you when it is time to
swap devices.</p></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Keep a sleep diary</strong> – we will send you a link by
text or email every morning where you can record how you slept. This
will take 1-2 minutes and soon becomes a habit.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Give feedback</strong> on your experience participating and
help us to improve the study design based on your experience of having
epilepsy.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div
id="will-taking-part-in-this-study-require-me-to-change-anything-about-how-i-take-my-medication"
class="section level3">
<h3>Will taking part in this study require me to change anything about
how I take my medication?</h3>
<p>No. It is very important that you do not change anything about how
you take your medication because of this study. You must not make any
changes to how you take your medication unless advised by your
doctor.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="when-will-i-need-to-do-all-these-tasks-if-i-agree-to-take-part"
class="section level3">
<h3>When will I need to do all these tasks if I agree to take part?</h3>
<p>The tasks in this study will be arranged at times that suit you.
There will need to be 1 week when you are able to use the bedside sensor
continuously. It is no problem to take the bedside sensor with you to
another location if you need to travel during this time.</p>
<p>After you have read this information sheet, and if you decide that
the study is something you would still be interested in, we will have a
short conversation (in person, by phone, MS Teams or email) to ensure
that you are eligible to participate. This conversation is confidential
and the information you give us at this time will not be recorded. If
you meet the inclusion criteria, we will then send you information on
what is involved and give you time to read this and to ask questions.
Next we will ask you to meet again (in person or online, your choice) to
give written consent to participate. Then we will enrol you into the
study and arrange a 1 week study window that suits you to participate,
and send you the sensors with instructions on their use. You will have
the names and contact details of the researchers who you can contact at
any time during the study, should you have any questions.</p>
<p>To summarise, over the 1 week of the study we will (i) record
questionnaire data at the beginning, (ii) continuously record daily
movement data using the wrist worn sensors, and the bedside sensor, and
(iii) measure the times that you take your medication every day.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="can-the-sensors-record-images" class="section level3">
<h3>Can the sensors record images?</h3>
<p>No, the sensors only measure movement in space, none of them can
acquire images.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="can-the-sensors-record-what-i-am-saying-or-other-sounds"
class="section level3">
<h3>Can the sensors record what I am saying or other sounds?</h3>
<p>No, the sensors record noise levels in decibels, they can’t identify
sounds or record speech.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="can-the-sensors-identify-my-location" class="section level3">
<h3>Can the sensors identify my location?</h3>
<p>No, none of our sensor have GPS or capacity to identify or record
their location.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="can-the-bedside-radar-sensors-identify-what-i-am-doing"
class="section level3">
<h3>Can the bedside radar sensors identify what I am doing?</h3>
<p>The sensors record data on movement but it is not possible to
identify what someone is doing other than whether they are awake or not.
We apply algorithms to the movement data at each timepoint to classify
whether the person is asleep or awake – it is categorical information,
either awake or asleep, nothing else. The data cannot be used to detect
sexual or any other activity nor would we ever attempt to detect
anything from the movement data other than the classification of being
awake or asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="can-the-bedside-radar-sensor-record-data-from-my-partner"
class="section level3">
<h3>Can the bedside radar sensor record data from my partner?</h3>
<p>The sensors will only record data from you and not your partner (as
long as you are the person closest to the sensor). Your participation in
this study does affect your partner as we will record light, sound and
temperature data in their bedroom, and we ask you to make sure anyone
sharing your bedroom is happy for you to participate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="are-there-any-benefits-to-me-if-i-take-part-in-the-study"
class="section level3">
<h3>Are there any benefits to me if I take part in the study?</h3>
<p>Medical advances depend on the goodwill of volunteers that
participate in research studies, and we believe that you will benefit
from knowing you are making a valuable contribution to finding ways to
help people with epilepsy. We are very grateful to everyone that
participates in our research.</p>
<p>You will receive data from the radar sensors that show how your own
sleep patterns and medication timing vary over the week of the study.
This will benefit you by helping you to understand more about how you
sleep. We will give you this data for your own interest at the end of
the study, but we are not medical doctors and we won’t be able to help
you understand it.</p>
<p>You will receive a One4All voucher (€20) to thank you for your
participation.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-you-find-any-problems-with-my-sleep"
class="section level3">
<h3>What if you find any problems with my sleep?</h3>
<p>There is a possibility that the tests we carry out identify that your
sleep patterns are not what we expect to see in a healthy person. If
this happens, we will let you know and we will give you copies of the
data we collected. We are not medical doctors, so we will not be able to
give you any advice but we will recommend that you discuss our findings
with your GP.</p>

<h3>Are there any risks to me or others if I take part in the
study?</h3>
<p>We have taken great care to identify and address any potential safety
concerns, and we do not consider that taking part presents a risk to the
participants but we do ask you to pay attention to the following sources
of risk. Remember if you are unsure about anything, please feel free to
contact our research team at <a href="mailto:TimeAlign@mu.ie"
class="email">TimeAlign@mu.ie</a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is a small possibility that you might develop skin
irritation from the wrist worn strap and we will ask you to be vigilant
to this, and to remove the strap immediately and withdraw from the study
if signs of irritation are detected. All the items we use are
medical-grade and we do not anticipate skin irritation to be a serious
risk.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a chance that the cables and wires of the sensors could
be a trip hazard and we ask you to take care when moving near them and
to make sure that all ends are tucked away.</p></li>

</div>
<div
id="what-identifiable-information-about-me-will-be-used-as-part-of-this-study"
class="section level3">
<h3>What identifiable information about me will be used as part of this
study?</h3>
<p>With your consent, when we enrol you in the study, we will record
your name, address and contact details (email and phone number). We will
use your contact details to contact you about the research study, and
not for any other reason. This data that can identify is highly
confidential and will be destroyed when you have completed the
study.</p>
<p>As soon as you have enrolled in the study, you will be assigned a
unique study ID code - this is called pseudonymisation. Any information
we gather from that point (sensor data and questionnaire data) will be
associated with the ID code and not with your name or contact details.
This is not only for electronically stored data. For example,
questionnaires will be labelled with your unique study IDs and not your
name. Only the authorised research team at Maynooth University will have
access to the ‘key’ that links your name to your ID code, and this
information will be stored on an encrypted file on a password protected
computer at Maynooth University. Neither your name nor ID code will be
used when reporting the results of this research for publication or
presentation; your contribution will be entirely anonymous. In this way,
even the researchers working directly with your data will not know which
participant it comes from; this link can only be made by retrieving the
key.</p>
<p>The only reason we have a key at all is so that we can contact you to
collect sensors and follow up with results, and we will destroy the key
and all your contact information as soon as possible. This will be when
you have completed the study or at the end of TimeAlign (December 2028),
whichever comes first.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-other-data-will-be-collected-about-me-during-the-study"
class="section level3">
<h3>What other data will be collected about me during the study?</h3>
<p>There are three types of data in this study (i) personal,
identifiable data, (ii) personal data, (iii) anonymised data.</p>
<p>The personal, identifiable information that we will collect are your
name, address and contact details (phone number and email address).
These data can be used to identify you and are highly confidential. They
will never be written on any of your research data items such as
questionnaires or samples or sensor results. They will be linked to your
research data via your study ID number and kept in a locked office or
secure network that is separate to the research data stores. This means
that even the researchers will not be able to tell the identify of the
participants from the research data they are working on. We will delete
your identifiable data as soon as the study is over.</p>
<p>The research data that we collect about you includes personal
information such as data on sleep, sensor data, lifestyle and health,
age and sex, but these data are not unique to you and cannot be used to
identify you without access to the ID code key. These data are
pseudonymised until the end of the study (or Dec 2028 whichever is
first) at which point all identifiable data are deleted and all personal
data are anonymised. The personal research data will be identified only
by an ID number and will be stored in a secure location on the MU
server. Pseudonymised data will not be shared with anyone outside the
research team.</p>
<p>Anonymised data means that all connections to your identity have been
irretrievably destroyed and there is no way that anyone (not even the
researchers) can ever find out that information came from you. We ask
your consent to retain this anonymous information indefinitely and to
share it with other researchers via scientific repositories.
Repositories are public databases that can be accessed by anyone and are
very important for progressing science and preventing other scientists
repeating work that has already been done. Releasing our research data
into the public domain like this means that science will benefit for
many years after our project has finished, and that the experiments do
not have to be repeated.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div
id="will-any-of-my-data-be-shared-with-anyone-outside-maynooth-university"
class="section level3">
<h3>Will any of my data be shared with anyone outside Maynooth
University?</h3>
<p>Some of your pseudonymised (not your identifiable information)
personal information (date of birth, sex and sensor data) will be shared
with a data service provider (VitalThings). This company supplies the
sensors that we use and they are responsible for the transmission of
data from the sensors to a cloud based platform that they maintain, and
where the data are stored until the researchers at Maynooth University
can download it. These data are identified by a study ID and can never
be used to infer your identity. They will be made completely anonymous
by Maynooth University researchers once the data have been
downloaded.</p>
<p>A data processing agreement has been signed between Maynooth
University and VitalThings that will ensure that they maintain high
standards of data security and governance and that they are GDPR
compliant. This method of temporary data storage in the cloud is the
most efficient way that we can acquire and store large amounts of sensor
data. VitalThings will never have access to your name, address or
contact information. They require access to your age and sex in order to
calculate your sleep information. We will also store these anonymised
data indefinitely in Maynooth University and in data repositories so
that they can be used in future research and/or for teaching purposes
(for example, student projects).</p>
<p>We will share your pseudonymised (not your identifiable information)
personal information (questionnaire and diary data) with a data
collection platform provider (onlinesurveys.ac.uk). This company
administers the platform where you complete your questionnaires online.
Onlinesurveys.ac host the questionnaires and store the data until the
researchers at Maynooth University can download it. These data are
identified by a study ID and can never be used to infer your identity.
They will be made completely anonymous by Maynooth University
researchers once the data have been downloaded.</p>

<div id="what-happens-to-my-data-if-i-decide-to-withdraw"
class="section level3">
<h3>What happens to my data if I decide to withdraw?</h3>
<p>If you decide to withdraw from the study, then all data will be
destroyed; nothing will be retained for anonymisation in this case. You
will be completely removed from the study. If you withdraw we will
ensure that our third party processor, VitalThings deletes your
pseudonymised data from the sensors, sex and date of birth data. If you
complete the study, your data will be anonymised and it will not be
possible to withdraw from the study after this point.</p>

id="will-my-personal-data-andor-sensor-data-be-used-in-future-studies"
class="section level3">
<h3>Will my personal data and/or sensor data be used in future
studies?</h3>
<p>The data we collect will be anonymised once the sensors and
questionnaires have been returned, so it will not be possible for
anyone, including the research team to identify the participants from
the datasets. With your consent, we will retain these anonymous datasets
indefinitely. These datasets may be used in teaching or research.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="will-i-have-access-to-the-data-generated-by-future-studies"
class="section level3">
<h3>Will I have access to the data generated by future studies?</h3>
<p>No. Following completion of the study or withdrawal from the study,
your identifiable personal information including your name, address and
contact details will be destroyed. All other data (sensor and
questionnaire data) will then be anonymised (it will no longer be linked
back to you), and it will not be possible for us or anyone to identify
you. For this reason, we cannot return any of your results after
anonymization and you will not be able to withdraw, request access, or
to make any amendments after the data are anonymised. This anonymised
data will be held in Maynooth University and made available in public
repositories for indefinite open access.</p>

<div
id="who-will-access-my-identifiable-personal-data-as-part-of-this-study"
class="section level3">
<h3>Who will access my identifiable personal data as part of this
study?</h3>
<p>Only the authorised researchers named above, working in the research
team at Maynooth University will have access to your identifiable
personal data including your name, address, and contact details. All
other data (sensor data, age, biological sex, clinical information and
sleep data) are only identifiable by your unique study ID. We will never
label your questionnaires or sensor data with your name or contact
details. VitalThings and researchers at other universities cannot access
your identifiable information. Only the research team at MU can ever
find out your identify, and this is only for the purposes of contacting
you about the study. As soon as the study is completed all your
identifiable information will be destroyed and there is no way that you
can ever be linked to study data again.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-my-privacy-be-protected" class="section level3">
<h3>How will my privacy be protected?</h3>
<p>Your personal information will be kept entirely confidential, and we
will exercise our duties in handling your personal data as per the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Protecting your privacy is
extremely important to all the research team members at Maynooth
University. Personal Identifiers, such as your name or email are never
used to label your questionnaires or sensor data. All data will be
stored on password protected files on a secure network in Maynooth
University. No one outside of the research team in Maynooth University
will have access to your name or contact information and all other data
will be labelled with your unique study ID.</p>
<p>Although all measures will be taken to protect your privacy, there is
a remote risk that a connection to your contact details could be made,
e.g., through unauthorised access to servers of premises at Maynooth
University. To minimise this risk, any files containing these data are
password protected and have restricted access, or are in locked cabinets
in locked offices. Any attempt to identify you in this manner would be a
legal breach against the permitted use of the research data.</p>
<p>When you have returned the sensors and questionnaires, and the study
is complete, your contact details will be incinerated in the case of
written records, and electronic data will be reformatted or overwritten
by the research team at Maynooth University and all data will be
anonymous.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-lawful-basis-to-use-my-personal-data"
class="section level3">
<h3>What is the lawful basis to use my personal data?</h3>
<p>As part of the study your personal data will only be used for
scientific research which is in the public interests (Article 6 (e) and
Article 9( 2) (j) of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-my-rights" class="section level3">
<h3>What are my rights?</h3>
<p>Under the GDPR, you are entitled to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to access to your data and receive a copy of it.<br />
</li>
<li>The right to restrict or object to processing of your data.<br />
</li>
<li>The right to object to any further processing of the information we
hold about you (except where it is de-identified).<br />
</li>
<li>The right to have inaccurate information about you corrected or
deleted.<br />
</li>
<li>The right to receive your data in a portable format and to have it
transferred to another data controller.<br />
</li>
<li>The right to request deletion of your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rights to access to your data are forfeit in this study by the
complete anonymisation of the data. Complete anonymisation is to protect
the privacy and data security of the participants, but it also means
that it is impossible for you to access your data for any reason. We
will not record the identity of the participants that provided any
specific item of data, so we will not be able to give you access to your
data or to make any amendments.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that, in some circumstances, confidentiality of
research data and records may be overridden by courts in the event of
litigation or in the course of investigation by lawful authority. In
such circumstances the University will take all reasonable steps within
law to ensure that confidentiality is maintained to the greatest
possible extent.</p>
